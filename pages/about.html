        I've always had an insatiable curiosity. When I got my first computer at age 9 I learned to navigate the windows 3.1 
        operating system. It was an old hand-me-down 386 machine with a text editor and a few built in games. At the 
        time windows 95 was already out and I struggled to install any new software on it. When I was around 16 I 
        started playing around with various Linux and BSD systems. From there I learned the basics of system administration, 
        shell scripting and later Python. <br>
        I was a restless kid. Constantly feeling drawn between my many interests and finding it difficult to completely
        dedicate myself to one. And my main interests have stayed the same for as long as I can
        remember. Music, reptiles, computers, martial arts, cooking, photography, books, movies, puzzles and 
        video games are probably my greatest interests. 
        After a year at my first school I decided to drop out and lived for a year with my
        grandfather in Nicaragua.
        Here I learned Spanish and also basic construction skills. I came back to Sweden and tried to
        juggle both work and school.
        I took two classes in Programming (C++ and Java) finished both with great grades but ended up not finishing
        school this time either.
        Now I'm back and my full attention for the past two years have been to advance my knowledge of .NET and web
        design.
