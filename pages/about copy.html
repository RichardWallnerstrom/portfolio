        I've always had an insatiable curiosity. And my main interests have stayed the same for as long as I can remember. 
        As a child my greatest interests were snakes, video games and martial arts. 
        When I got my first computer at age 9 I learned to navigate the windows 3.1 operating system. It was an old 
        hand-me-down 386 machine with a text editor and a few built in games. At the time windows 95 was already out and I struggled to install any new software on it.
        I did manage to install Beneath a Steel Sky, and even since Point and Click and puzzle games have always been among my favorites. 
        When I was around 16 I started playing around with various Linux and BSD systems. From there I learned the basics of shell scripting and later Python. 
        I was a restless kid. Constantly feeling drawn between my many interests and finding it difficult to completely dedicate myself to one. 
        At this point in time I was playing guitar and singing. I had dozens of snakes, lizards, spiders, scorpions and other strange animals that I had collected. 
        I was training several different martial arts, usually up to 5 days a week and with the little time I had left I would either hang out with my friends or 
        play some video games. After a year at my first school I decided to drop out and lived for a year with my grandfather in Nicaragua. 
        Here I learned Spanish and also basic construction skills. I came back to Sweden a married man and tried to juggle both work and school.
        I took two classes in Programming (C++ and Java) finished both with great grades but ended up not finishing school this time either. 
        Now I'm back and my full attention for the past two years have been to advance my knowledge of .NET and web design.
