            I like simple, clean design with dark colors.

            I love solving puzzles. That's why I prefer the back-end. The solution is absolute.
            It either works or it doesn't.

            I have some experience in Maya and 3DsMax. I prefer designing structures  
            to characters. <br>
            Music, on the other hand, has always been a big part of my life. 
            It's the only human art form that truly captivates me.
