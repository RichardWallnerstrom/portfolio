        I've always had an insatiable curiosity. When I got my first computer at age 9 I learned to navigate the windows 3.1 
        operating system. It was an old hand-me-down 386 machine with a text editor and a few built in games. At the 
        time windows 95 was already out and I struggled to install any new software on it. When I was around 16 I 
        started playing around with various Linux and BSD systems. From there I learned the basics of system administration, 
        shell scripting and later Python. <br>
        I was a restless kid with too many interests. Music, computers, reptiles, martial arts, warhammer and DnD to name a few. 
        After a year at Sval√∂vs naturbruksgymnasium I decided to drop out because of lack of reptiles and amphibians.
        I decided to move to Nicaragua for a while and live with my grandfather who owned a farm there. There I learned Spanish 
        and basic construction skills. I came back to Sweden and tried to juggle both work and school.
        I took several classes, including Programming A and B (C++ and Java) which I completed with great grades. I was now around 20 and 
        worked for different zoo stores, (one was the largest in scandinavia), but all three went bankrupt. Not long after 
        this I spent over 5 years almost incapacitated because of my illness. Long story short, all I could do was to sit at my computer. 
        I spent this time creating maps for Quake 3 and models for the maps in Maya. After years of proper physical and medical 
        therapy I was well again and I haven't had to eat any medication since. <br>        
        Now I'm back and my full attention for the past two years have been to advance my knowledge of .NET and web design.
