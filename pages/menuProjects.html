            I'm not much of a visual designer. When I do design,
            I like very simple UI with dark, natural colors.

            I love solving puzzles. That's why I prefer the back-end. The solution is absolute.
            It either works or it doesn't.

            I play guitar, piano, sing as well as produce and mix music.
