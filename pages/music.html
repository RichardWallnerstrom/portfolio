    <h3>Music production</h3>
    <p>
        I have always dabbled in music. I learned to play basic piano by myself as a child and learned to play guitar at around 13. At 14 I
        started to mess around with Cubase. After experimenting with a variety of different DAW's like FL, Reason, Logic and Pro Tools
        I eventually discovered Ableton which I have been using for the past 10+ years.
