		I've always had an insatiable curiosity. At the age of 9 I got my first 386
		with windows 3.1. As a teen I started playing around with various Linux and
		BSD systems and learned the basics of system administration and shell
		scripting.

		I was a restless kid with many interests. Music, computers, reptiles,
		martial arts and all kinds of games. After a year at Sval√∂vs
		naturbruksgymnasium I dropped out because of lack of reptiles and
		amphibians. I decided to move to Nicaragua for a while and live with my
		grandfather where I learned construction, farming, cooking and Spanish. I
		came back to Sweden just over a year later and managed to land a job in the
		reptile department in the largest pet store in the country. Unfortunately
		they went bankrupt and not long after did my reumatism appear. Long story
		short, all I could do was to sit at my computer. I spent this time creating
		maps for Quake 3 and models for the maps in Maya. After years of proper
		physical and medical therapy I was finally well again and I haven't had to
		take any medication since. <br />

		I spent 6 years working in restaurants but longing for a challenge in life.
		I started getting back into programming and enlisted at Lexicons "boot
		camp". Now I'm ready and hungrier than ever. My full attention for the past
		two years have been to advance my knowledge of C#, web development and
		Unity.<br /><br />

		I hope to one day direct a 2D Adventure game.
