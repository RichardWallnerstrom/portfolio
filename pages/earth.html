        Dominant species 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tardigrades: Fascinating species nearly immortal. Can survive in vacuum, helium and temperatures down to -272 Â°C.
        Mosquito sp.: (Culicidae sp.) Parasitic species that drink the blood from other animals. Only females bite. 
        Humans: Parasitic species that spread around the planet. They eat everything but are particularly interested in the domesticated cow. 
        They use tools and materials to transform their surroundings, usually destroying everything in their paths, including themselves. 
        They value something they call money over everything else. It seems to be some form of commodity but in itself its completely useless.
        They are split into different tribes. Most hate all other tribes and kill them whenever possible. They have a primitive type of exploding
        device that destroys the environment and all living things nearby. 
        Because of their egoistic nature and warmongering the council has decided not to provide them with any further technology.
        Mothership AI predicts they will destroy themselves within 200 years.
