            I'm not much of a visual designer. When I do design,
            I like very simple UI with dark, natural colors.

            I love solving puzzles. That's why I prefer the back-end. The solution is absolute.
            It either works or it doesn't.

            I always wanted to learn to draw. But I must be missing a bone because the only visual art I
            can ever create is 3D Models. I dabbled with both Maya and 3DsMax to create models for Quake maps. 
            Music, on the other hand, has always been a big part of my life. Music just comes easy for me. 
            It's the only human art form that truly captivates me.
