	<p class="largeText">Dominant species</p>
	<p>
		Tardigrades: Fascinating species nearly immortal. Can survive in vacuum,
		helium and temperatures down to -272 Â°C. Mosquito sp.: (Culicidae sp.)
		Parasitic species that drink the blood from other animals. Only females
		bite. Humans: Parasitic species that spread around the planet. They eat
		everything but are particularly interested in the domesticated cow. They use
		tools and materials to transform their surroundings, usually destroying
		everything in their paths, including themselves. They value something they
		call money over everything else. It seems to be some form of commodity but
		in itself its completely useless. They are split into different tribes. Most
		hate all other tribes and kill them whenever possible. They have a primitive
		type of exploding device that destroys the environment and all living things
		nearby. Because of their egoistic nature and warmongering the council has
		decided not to provide them with any further technology. Mothership AI
		predicts they will destroy themselves within 200 years.
