				Facts: <br />
				<br />
				The leading hypothesis to how the moon was created (Giant Impact),
				states that the moon was once a part of earth but early in its life
				cycle, it was hit by a mars-sized body "causing a fragmentation and
				thorough mixing of both parent bodies". <br />
				Another fun fact. If you would pile all the planets in our solar system
				on each other they would fit between earth and the moon.
