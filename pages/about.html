        I've always had an insatiable curiosity. When I got my first computer at age 9 I learned to navigate the windows 3.1 
        operating system. It was an old hand-me-down 386 machine with a text editor and a few built in games. At the 
        time windows 95 was already out and I struggled to install any new software on it. When I was around 16 I 
        started playing around with various Linux and BSD systems. From there I learned the basics of system administration, 
        shell scripting and later Python. <br>
        I was a restless kid with too many interests. Music, computers, reptiles, martial arts and all kinds of games. 
        After a year at Sval√∂vs naturbruksgymnasium I dropped out because of lack of reptiles and amphibians.
        I decided to move to Nicaragua for a while and live with my grandfather who owned a farm there. There I learned Spanish 
        and basic construction skills. I came back to Sweden just over a year later and tried to juggle both work and school.
        I was now around 20 and worked for different zoo stores. And here I spent over 5 years almost incapacitated because of my reumatism. 
        Long story short, all I could do was to sit at my computer. I spent this time creating maps for Quake 3 and models for the maps in Maya. 
        After years of proper physical and medical therapy I was finally well again and I haven't had to take any medication since. <br>        
        Now I'm back and my full attention for the past two years have been to advance my knowledge of .NET and web design.<br>
        I hope to one day direct a Point and Click game.
